/**
 * A class for calculating discounts on grocery items.
 * 
 * This code already works BUT there is significant duplication between
 * calculateFixedDiscount and calculatePercentageDiscount.
 * 
 * Here's what to do:
 * 
 * 1.  Figure out a design that eliminates the duplication.  Use interfaces to do it.
 * Draw a (small, quick) UML diagram of the relevant parts
 * Get an instructor to sign off on your design before you proceed.
 * 2.  Implement the solution you've decided on, keeping the functionality the same
 * 3.  Modify the functionality so all discounts are listed on separate lines after the item.
 * For example:
 * SPAM           $5.00   
 * DISCOUNT 10%  -$0.50
 * 4.  Add a new discount that is a "Buy X get Y free" where just buying one thing doesn't
 * give a discount, but then subsequent buys can become free if you buy enough
